InterMine is an "Open Source Data Warehousing system" for biological data. It is used to store and deliver data to biologists in a number of useful and simple formats. The first implementation of this was FlyMine, at www.flymine.org, and it has since been used to store data about Rat, Yeast, Human and Mouse organisms.

My goal for the project is to implement a data mining solution for InterMine to enable the discovery of similar objects to ones specified by the user. For example, given a gene and a set of information (GO terms, Pathway information, etc.), find other genes that are statistically similar to the given gene. If time allows, these features will be extended to list analysis.
